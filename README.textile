h2. SignalMap

Just an idea that I wanted to try out after reading a discussionbetween @jhooks, @matanube and @mark_star about whether or not to use a signal bus in Robotlegs. 
Wanted to make a create a helper class for quicker adding and mappingnew signals to the application. 

h3. Rationale 

When using as3 signals in Robotlegs you need to subclass the Signal class and map it, or use a signal bus. The subclassing approach can make you need 
to manually create and map many classes. On the other hand, @jhooks says that "monolithic controllers tend to break SRP and are generally prone to abuse exposing too much to too many actors." 

Using the SignalMap you can create a new Signal and map either in your main setup or on the fly.

h3. Usage

Create a new instance of SignalMap (map it if you need to access the signal map in other application tiers) in your main context or your command setup class

pre. var signalMap:ISignalMap = new SignalMap(injector);
injector.mapValue(ISignalMap, signalMap); //map if needed injected later

Start creating and mapping your signals (you can pass as many parameters as you need)
pre. signalMap.createSignal(nameOfSignal:String, parameters);

Then in your mediator, command or actor inject the signal by using the named injection option. The name needs to be the same as used when creating the signal.

pre. [Inject(name="nameOfSignal")]
public var signalName:Signal;

See the example files for a working example.

Feedback welcomed.
